# SU25_MODEL
This is a system that helps high school students identify biological specimens.
## Objectives
- Help students quickly identify organisms in Biology textbooks.
- Increase the intuitiveness and interest in learning by applying AI to Biology.
- Provide a brief and easy-to-understand description of the organism after identification.

## Implementation steps
1. Read and classify organisms in Biology textbooks for grade 12.
2. Select suitable species to collect image data.
3. Collect and process image data (normalize, augment...).
4. Build a machine learning model ( ResNet50, EfficientNet., YoLov8n ) for training.
5. Integrate the model into the backend/frontend system.
6. Evaluate and improve accuracy.

## Expected results
- The system is capable of classifying ~46 common species of organisms in Biology books.
- Simple interface, easy to use for students and teachers.
